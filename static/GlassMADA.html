    <h1> GlassMADA: A Memory Assistive Dislay for Perons with Alzheimer's</h1>
    <img src = "../res/glassMADA.jpg" width = 80%>
    <p> GlassMADA addresses and tackles the cognitive and memory issues concerning people in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's. Our solution aims to behave as a tool for the retrieval and review of forgotten information relevant to the userâ€™s personal life. Specifically, we focused on assisting the user with recognizing people and their relative affiliation as well as recording daily activities via image capture. With real-time people recognition, people with Alzheimer's can avoid the embarrassment of not knowing their families or friends or having to ask who they are. With daily activities recorded in form of photos, people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers will be able to review images in a reflective, therapeutical session about what has happened during the day.
